If you want to use File Validator in your projects, because we support
different libraries for file validation,you can refer to the following
links for a guide on using each of them: ðŸ‘‡


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   python_magic
   mimetypes
   filetype

There is also a method called safe mode that
uses all three libraries together to validate the file : ðŸ‘‡

    safe_mode
